# sphinx-aimms-theme

This Sphinx theme was designed to provide a great reader experience for documentation users on both desktop and mobile devices for AIMMS projects.

**This theme also includes:** 
- an **AIMMS [pygment lexer](http://pygments.org/)** to highlight your AIMMS [code blocks in sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block) 
- an **AIMMS [Domain](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/domains.html)** to document your own AIMMS code.

Please find the documentation of those 2 elements in the Wiki.

This theme is inherited from the great [Read the Docs](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) but can work with any Sphinx project. 

You can find a working demo of the theme on AIMMS documentation websites:
